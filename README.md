# LeetCode-Test-Case-Generator
A Java script to generate test cases for leetcode. For use on the command line only (Java installation required).<br><br>
As of June 9th, 2023, this script is still a WORK IN PROGESS. It's only useful for a couple of problems and the format of test cases they use, so use this script with that in mind. I do plan on keeping this updated and working with new test case formats that I encounter.<br><br>
Please contribute if you want to.
